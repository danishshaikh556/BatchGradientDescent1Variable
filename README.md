Linear Regression with 1 variable : 
   Machine Learning
   
   
   linear regression with one
variable to predict prots for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a
restaurant franchise and are considering dierent cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for
prots and populations from the cities.
   The le ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression prob-
lem. The rst column is the population of a city and the second column is
the prot of a food truck in that city. A negative value for prot indicates a
loss.
